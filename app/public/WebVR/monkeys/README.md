# Monkey See, Monkey Do
Monkeys arranged symmetrically in 4D space, in VR.

The sculptures visualise different 4D symmetry groups. 
A monkey motif is placed in each cube, octahedron or dodecahedron of the 8-, 24- or 120-cell, giving objects with symmetry groups the 8-element quaternion group, the binary tetrahedral group, and the binary icosahedral group respectively. 
The designs are radially projected to the 3-sphere then stereographically projected to 3-space. 
The VR experience animates each of these, showing one generator of each symmetry group. 
The virtual monkeys are coloured by an algorithm based on the Hopf fibration from the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere, which is then embedded in the RGB colour cube.
