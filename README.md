I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Melbourne Networked Society Institute and the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music for their great support and for giving me the opportunity to work on this project as an internship as part of my Masters of Information Technology at The University of Melbourne. Special thanks go to our customer Dr. Jeanette Tamplin for giving all the feedback needed for the development of the project. I would also like to thank my supervisor from MNSI Ken Clarke for his continuous support and for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. And last but not least, Chamil Lakshan Jayasundara for his technical advice given, some features of the project could not have been finished without his input.

# Abstract
Telecommunication technologies are a fundamental part of our daily life. The Internet is becoming more and more available in different parts of the world, including rural areas. Nowadays some people may even think that having access to the Internet is as important as having water or electricity services delivered to their households. Thanks to these telecommunication technologies, existing services allow communication between people who are hundreds or even thousands of kilometres apart.
The purpose of this project was to enable these technologies to be used by clinicians in music therapy in order to have singing lessons with people in remote locations diagnosed with quadriplegia. Having an online system that allows group singing will help clinicians to keep interacting with, and treating, these people. The project will be focused on creating a Proof of Concept service that will minimize latency, or delay, issues to simulate a singing lesson between different participants.
The project was built on an existing web conference service that was implemented by a previous intern at the Melbourne Networked Society Institute (MNSI) formerly known as Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society (IBES).
